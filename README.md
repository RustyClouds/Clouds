# rustyclouds.github.io
<p> This is my first github page. It's a programming exercise for me, using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. </p>
<p> The website shows a collection of clouds aka song sketches I made for a daily music project. It's work in progress. E.g. I'd like to add more clouds, the clouds should float and on pressing the clouds the song should play immediately instead of being directed to my song on youtube </p>
